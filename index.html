        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrency continues to draw interest from retail and institutional investors alike, and with that comes an ever-growing number of new exchanges claiming to offer better, faster, and safer trading experiences. One such name is <strong>Extsy.com</strong>, a platform that is currently raising both interest and suspicion. This review aims to provide a factual, experience-informed perspective on Extsy’s legitimacy, risks, and transparency—or lack thereof.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Is Extsy.com Really New?</h2>
            <p>On the surface, Extsy.com may appear to be an established domain, having been registered back in 2002. However, a quick investigation using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250115000000*/https://extsy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wayback Machine</a> reveals that the website as we know it today only began operation in late 2024 or early 2025. This indicates a significant shift in ownership or business purpose, meaning it cannot be treated as a legacy platform.</p>

            <p>Despite the age of the domain, this exchange has <strong>no operational track record</strong> in the crypto industry. For investors, this means there's no historical performance, user experience, or transparency to judge it by.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Trustpilot Reviews: Authentic or Manufactured?</h2>
            <p>As is increasingly common with new businesses, Extsy.com has created a profile on Trustpilot. What stands out, however, is that <strong>90% of the reviews are five-star rated</strong>, and all appeared shortly after the exchange's official launch in March 2025. This is highly unusual for any brand-new platform that hasn’t yet had time to build a real customer base.</p>

            <p>While Trustpilot markets itself as a hub for genuine feedback, there’s no reliable way to confirm that these reviews come from actual users. In this context, the overwhelmingly positive ratings raise valid concerns. How did a completely new exchange suddenly get a flood of perfect reviews? The absence of neutral or critical feedback is a potential red flag for manipulation or fake testimonials.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Regulatory Compliance and Licensing Issues</h2>
            <p>One of the most significant concerns is Extsy’s regulatory status—or lack thereof. Although the platform appears to onboard users globally, including jurisdictions where crypto exchanges are required to be licensed, <strong>Extsy.com is not licensed anywhere</strong>. This makes its operations illegal in several key markets including the U.S., U.K., Canada, and much of the EU.</p>

            <p>The company is registered in Lithuania, which is often viewed as an offshore jurisdiction for financial services. While not all offshore firms are scams, a large percentage do operate with lax oversight. This increases the risk of <strong>funds being frozen, withheld, or mismanaged</strong>, leaving customers with little to no recourse.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Lack of Real-World Reputation and Community Feedback</h2>
            <p>Reputable crypto exchanges typically have a strong online presence—YouTube reviews, Reddit discussions, Twitter mentions, and blog posts with active comment sections. Extsy.com has none of these. There is no verifiable community engagement, no developer updates, and no mentions by crypto thought leaders or analysts.</p>

            <p>Until independent reviewers and everyday users begin sharing their experiences publicly, there’s simply no reason to trust the claims made by the company itself. Without this kind of <strong>peer-verified transparency</strong>, Extsy remains a mystery—and not the good kind.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Final Verdict</h2>
            <p>At this time, Extsy.com is a <strong>high-risk platform</strong>. It lacks transparency, has no verifiable track record, is not licensed, and seems to rely heavily on unverifiable reviews. While it may not be an outright scam, all the signs suggest a platform that <em>should be approached with extreme caution</em>.</p>

            <p>Until the company becomes properly licensed and receives genuine, verifiable reviews from the broader crypto community, we cannot recommend Extsy.com for crypto trading or investment.</p>
